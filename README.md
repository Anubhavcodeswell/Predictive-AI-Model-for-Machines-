This project develops a predictive AI model to forecast industrial machine failures using sensor data from the AI4I 2020 dataset. By implementing a Random Forest classifier with optimized class weights, it analyzes parameters like temperature, torque, and tool wear to predict equipment failures with 99.93% accuracy. The solution helps manufacturers reduce downtime through proactive maintenance, featuring full data preprocessing, imbalance handling, and explainable AI insights into critical failure factors.
