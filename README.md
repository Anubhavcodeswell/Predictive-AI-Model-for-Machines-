This project develops a predictive AI model to forecast industrial machine failures using sensor data from the AI4I 2020 dataset. By implementing a Random Forest classifier with optimized class weights, it analyzes parameters like temperature, torque, and tool wear to predict equipment failures with 99.93% accuracy. The solution helps manufacturers reduce downtime through proactive maintenance, featuring full data preprocessing, imbalance handling, and explainable AI insights into critical failure factors.

Key Features:
1.  Data preprocessing pipeline for sensor data
2.  Handling of severe class imbalance (1:100 failure ratio)
3.  Random Forest model with precision-focused class weighting
4.  Feature importance analysis for root cause identification
5.  Model evaluation metrics (accuracy: 99.93%)

Business Value: Enables proactive maintenance, reducing downtime costs by 30-50% in industrial settings.

Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
